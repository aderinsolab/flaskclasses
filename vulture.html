            <h2>Black is impacted</h2>
            <p>when you say something is impacted you are basically talking about black people,we've made so many belittled impacts on the world
                in such a way that it can't go unoticed.When you hear black shines brightest cause we are being forced to keep our heads down so
                much cause our light is so different,we human beings are allowed to shine but because we are black we are told that our light don't
                matter.In the end they realize our lights cant be hidden cause its too bright ,they take our creativity and give they new names and 
                call them there inventions ,making us look so unipacted and useless in the end they find out.

                blues,jazz and rap.Black poems are inextricably linked to the experience of African Americans through their history in Americans 
                through their history in America, from slavery to segregation and the equal rights movement.
